# Twitter Alternative Hotspots for Cybersecurity Folks
Given the very reasonable concerns about Twitter's future and how large and active the cybersecurity / infosec community is on Twitter, I felt it prudent to gather alternative hotspots into a consolidated list to help us find each other. This is less alarmism and more about smart diversification and failovers in community.

This list will be updated as I find value in more locations. I may also consider expanding this to other apps/sites but for now Mastodon and Discord are my alternative go-tos.

## Mastodon
* [Infosec.Exchange](https://infosec.exchange/about)
* [Counter.Social](https://counter.social/index.html)

I would be remiss in my responsibility as a person in The Cybers if I didn't mention a few additional points about Mastodon.
1. It's distributed and the instances you're connecting to are managed by people not corporations (in most cases) which means the maintenance, security, privacy controls, and response to any issues is all up to the instance owner. Interesting read from a privacy perspective: [clening/MastodonPrivacyGuide](https://github.com/clening/MastodonPrivacyGuide)
2. Instance owners and moderators can evidently see every bit of content in their instance. So can Twitter admins, but at least there are compensating controls and financial incentives for Twitter to maintain a healthy balance.
3. In my opinion you should assume all content and conversations on any Mastodon instance are fully compromised by one or more third parties who do not have your best interests in mind. Assume Breach.

## Discord
* [Digital Forensics](https://discord.com/invite/digitalforensics) - this is one of the most massively helpful Discords I'm in. Job boards, niche areas of DFIR... there is a huge presence of law enforcement there -- just an awareness piece.
* [TrustedSec](https://discord.com/invite/trustedsec)
* [The OSINTion](https://discord.gg/p78TTGa) / [Main Site](https://www.theosintion.com/resources/)
* [Blue Team Village](https://discord.com/invite/blueteamvillage) / [Main Site](https://www.blueteamvillage.org/)
* [DEFCON](https://discord.com/invite/DEFCON)
* [BrakeSec Community](https://discord.com/invite/brakesec) / [Main Site](https://www.brakeingsecurity.com/)
* [Threat Hunter Community](https://discord.com/invite/2JjfB7E)
* [DeadPixelSec](https://discord.com/invite/deadpixelsec) / [Main Site](https://deadpixelsec.com/)
* [Infosec Knowledge Sharing](https://discord.com/invite/yfjE32fAf2)
* [Space Cows](https://discord.com/invite/BBgsXv8Cr9)

Similar caveats apply as Mastodon, except Discord is a more centralized and for-profit company so there is some more restriction and rigor on privacy and security.
